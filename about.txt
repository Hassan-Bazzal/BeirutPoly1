# Beirut Poly

**Beirut Poly** (sometimes stylized as *Beirut Ploy*) is a Beirut-themed adaptation of the classic Monopoly board game. It’s designed to reflect the vibrant, chaotic, and charming reality of life in **Beirut, Lebanon**.

## 🎲 Game Overview

Beirut Poly lets players buy, trade, and develop properties that represent real neighborhoods and iconic locations across the Lebanese capital. From the artsy corners of **Mar Mikhael** to the buzzing nightlife of **Hamra**, every move on the board immerses players deeper into the soul of the city.

## 🏙️ Key Features

- **Custom Board:** All properties, railroads, and utilities are renamed to match well-known Beirut landmarks and areas.
- **Wasta & Chaos Cards:** Replacing Chance and Community Chest, these cards bring local flavor with scenarios involving bureaucracy, political satire, or cultural quirks.
- **Local Currency:** Uses fictional Lebanese Lira or stylized bills referencing Lebanon’s economic situation.
- **Cultural References:** Street food, traffic jams, protests, rooftop water tanks, and electricity cuts — all part of the gameplay.
- **Playable Satire:** A fun yet biting commentary on Beirut’s social, economic, and political landscape.

## 👥 Who Is It For?

Beirut Poly is perfect for:
- Beirutis who love to laugh at their daily struggles.
- Expats missing the chaos of home.
- Visitors wanting a deeper cultural connection.
- Board game lovers seeking a unique regional twist.

## 🧠 Why It Stands Out

This is more than a game — it’s a love letter to Beirut. A place where strategy meets satire, and where every roll of the dice reflects the beautiful unpredictability of life in Lebanon.

**Play smart. Play bold. And don’t forget your Wasta.**
